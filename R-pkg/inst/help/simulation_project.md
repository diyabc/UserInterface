# Simulation project

Files related to "pseudo-observed dataset simulations" will be stored in a 
sub-directory `project_name` under the folder `Directory`. This sub-directory 
will be created for new projects.

If the box `Timestamp directory` is checked, then a timestamp will be appended 
to the directory name `project_name`. This box is disabled when opening an 
existing project.
